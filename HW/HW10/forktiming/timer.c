/* Created 27 Jan 2011.  This code contains start_counter() and
 * get_counter() functions that use the rdtsc instruction and return
 * the difference as a 32-bit unsigned. This code is therefore useful
 * only if the measurement interval is fairly short -- the target
 * length is much shorter than a timer tick: think 1 ms. If the
 * measurement interval is too long (and the counter value doesn't fit
 * in a 32-bit unsigned), get_counter() issues a fatal error message.
 *
 * Don't compile this file with -O3 or higher. Somehow the
 * optimizations mess up the values you get when reading the
 * counter. Maybe related to optimizations performed on
 * access_counter() which probably looks empty to the compiler.
